        <h4>
            
            
              <ls>

              <ul>
                  
                   <li>Cucumbers</li>

          <h3>The steps are very simple. Here's what you should do:</h3>

            <h4>
            <ls>    
                <ol>

                    <li> Chop the vegetables into small pieces after washing them (my personal option. You can chop them the way you want)</li>
                    <li> sink them in worm salty water for 30-60 seconds</li>
                    <li>Add the olive oil, and mix them on the plate.</li>

                </ol>

            </ls>
